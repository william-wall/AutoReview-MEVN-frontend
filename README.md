## Overview.

Reviews - AutoReview is a web app by where users write Reviews about motor vehicles and topics.

Chat-Rooms - Users also have the opportunity to create or join Chat Rooms and Chat in Real-Time to other authenticated users using socket I/O.

Gallery - Additionally there is a Gallery section where users submit vehicles with images and specifications.

Game - Another great feature of the application is the Puzzle Slider game. The user inputs an image into the application, from there the image will get shuffled into a number of custom picked pieces. The goal is to slide the squares into a mirror copy of the original image, with a little help from the app if needed.

Authentication - Users are authenticated through Googles cloud based Firebase platform.
